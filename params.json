Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer\r\nthrough early and continuous delivery\r\nof valuable software.\r\n\r\n2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in \r\ndevelopment. Agile processes harness change for \r\nthe customer's competitive advantage.\r\n\r\n3. Deliver working software frequently, from a \r\ncouple of weeks to a couple of months, with a \r\npreference to the shorter timescale.\r\n\r\n4. Business people and developers must work \r\ntogether daily throughout the project.\r\n\r\n5. Build projects around motivated individuals. \r\nGive them the environment and support they need, \r\nand trust them to get the job done.\r\n\r\n6. The most efficient and effective method of \r\nconveying information to and within a development \r\nteam is face-to-face conversation.\r\n\r\n7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.\r\n\r\n8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. \r\nThe sponsors, developers, and users should be able \r\nto maintain a constant pace indefinitely.\r\n\r\n9. Continuous attention to technical excellence \r\nand good design enhances agility.\r\n\r\n10. Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount \r\nof work not done--is essential.\r\n\r\n11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs \r\nemerge from self-organizing teams.\r\n\r\n12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how \r\nto become more effective, then tunes and adjusts \r\nits behavior accordingly.\r\n\r\n#### Waterfall Development Cycle\r\n\r\n![Waterfall Development](http://ecomcanada.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/White-Paper-Waterfall-Development.png)\r\n\r\n#### Scrum Development Cycle\r\n\r\n![Scrum Development Cycle](http://ecomcanada.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/White-Paper-Agile-Development-using-Scrum.png)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWhen we start a project - do we know More or Less than at the end?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n### Requirements, Backlog\r\n\r\n## Reference Material\r\n\r\nUseful links provided by their respective authors/owners I find useful.\r\n\r\n[Scrum Reference Card](http://scrumreferencecard.com/)\r\n\r\n[Scrum Training Series](http://scrumtrainingseries.com/)\r\n\r\n",
