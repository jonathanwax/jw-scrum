Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer\r\nthrough early and continuous delivery\r\nof valuable software.\r\n\r\n2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in \r\ndevelopment. Agile processes harness change for \r\nthe customer's competitive advantage.\r\n\r\n3. Deliver working software frequently, from a \r\ncouple of weeks to a couple of months, with a \r\npreference to the shorter timescale.\r\n\r\n4. Business people and developers must work \r\ntogether daily throughout the project.\r\n\r\n5. Build projects around motivated individuals. \r\nGive them the environment and support they need, \r\nand trust them to get the job done.\r\n\r\n6. The most efficient and effective method of \r\nconveying information to and within a development \r\nteam is face-to-face conversation.\r\n\r\n7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.\r\n\r\n8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. \r\nThe sponsors, developers, and users should be able \r\nto maintain a constant pace indefinitely.\r\n\r\n9. Continuous attention to technical excellence \r\nand good design enhances agility.\r\n\r\n10. Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount \r\nof work not done--is essential.\r\n\r\n11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs \r\nemerge from self-organizing teams.\r\n\r\n12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how \r\nto become more effective, then tunes and adjusts \r\nits behavior accordingly.\r\n\r\n#### Waterfall Development Cycle\r\n\r\n![Waterfall Development](http://ecomcanada.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/White-Paper-Waterfall-Development.png)\r\n\r\n#### Scrum Development Cycle\r\n\r\n![Scrum Development Cycle](http://ecomcanada.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/White-Paper-Agile-Development-using-Scrum.png)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWhen we start a project - do we know More or Less than at the end?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Scrum Elements\r\n\r\n#### Roles\r\n\r\n##### Role: Product Owner\r\n\r\n- Focused on **WHAT** not the HOW.\r\n\r\n- In-charge of ***ROI*** Product Priorities.\r\n\r\n- Single Point of Contact for Project Changes.\r\n\r\n##### Role: Scrum Dev Team\r\n\r\n- Focused on **HOW** to deliver usable feature(s) every sprint.\r\n\r\n- Responsible for keeping product **ALWAYS SHIPPABLE** (Shippable = Tested!)\r\n\r\n- Cross-functional: Requirements, Development, Testing...\r\n\r\n- Collaborative and Self Organizing\r\n\r\n- 4-9 Team Members\r\n\r\n##### Role: Scrum Master\r\n\r\n- Focused on Facilitating the Sprint Delivery\r\n\r\n- Has ***NO AUTHORITY*** over the team.\r\n\r\n- Is ***NOT*** The Project Manager\r\n\r\n- Protects Team from Distractions\r\n\r\n- Move impediments\r\n\r\n- Mentors Scrum Methodology\r\n\r\n- Enforce Time-boxes and Engineering Practices\r\n\r\n#### Artifacts\r\n\r\n##### Artifact: Product Backlog\r\n\r\n- A list of everything we want to do.\r\n\r\n- Written as User-Stories (or Use Case) Scenarios.\r\n\r\n- Anyone can add to the Backlog.\r\n\r\n- Prioritized by Product Owner.\r\n\r\n##### Artifact: Sprint Backlog\r\n\r\n- A list of Backlog-Items for \"THIS\" Sprint.\r\n\r\n- Backlog-Items are ***WHAT*** we committed to doing.\r\n\r\n- Tasks are the ***HOW*** we plan to do them.\r\n\r\n#### Meetings\r\n\r\n##### Sprint Planning Meeting\r\n\r\n1. Pull ***Top Priority*** Backlog-Items into Sprint Backlog-Items.\r\n\r\n2. Add ***Tasks*** to Sprint Backlog-Items to plan ***HOW*** to implement.\r\n\r\n3. Add ***Estimates*** to Sprint ***Tasks*** and confirm Sprint Feasibility.\r\n\r\n##### Daily Scrum Meeting\r\n\r\n15 min Daily Meeting - just the Team.\r\n\r\n1. What I did Yesterday.\r\n\r\n2. What I need to do Today.\r\n\r\n3. Is anything Impeding Me?\r\n\r\n##### Sprint Review Meeting\r\n\r\n2 Hours - Day before end of Sprint.\r\n\r\n1. Team Demonstrates a potentially shippable product to Product Owner and Stakeholders.\r\n\r\n2. Product Owner Decides Which Sprint Backlog-Items are Done.\r\n\r\n3. Product Stakeholders Decide if Sprint Backlog-Items is OK or needs to Change.\r\n\r\n##### Sprint Retrospective Meeting\r\n\r\n2 Hours - Day of Sprint Delivery\r\n\r\nDeals with our Process, How we deliver software.\r\n\r\n1. What went well?\r\n\r\n2. What can be improved?\r\n\r\n3. Feedback to each other.\r\n\r\n##### Backlog Refinement Meeting\r\n\r\nTeam reviews future Items with Product Owner for better planning.\r\n\r\n1. Review future Backlog-Items (2-3 sprints).\r\n\r\n2. Raise Questions, missing data, etc.\r\n\r\n3. Split Large Backlog-Items into smaller Items.\r\n\r\n4. Discuss Dependencies between Backlog-Items.\r\n\r\n###### I-N-V-E-S-T\r\n\r\nTop Priority Backlog-Items which are:\r\n\r\n- **I**ndependent - Is the Item designed to be decoupled?\r\n\r\n- **N**egotiable - Can Stakeholders and Dev Team understand the Item?\r\n\r\n- **V**aluable - What is the Customer/Business Value?\r\n\r\n- **E**stimable - Can we agree on an estimate? \r\n\r\n- **S**mall - Is the Item doable in one day?\r\n\r\n- **T**estable - Do we have clear Acceptance Criteria? How do we know its done?\r\n\r\n#### Rules \r\n\r\n### Requirements, Backlog\r\n\r\n## Reference Material\r\n\r\nUseful links provided by their respective authors/owners I find useful.\r\n\r\n[Scrum Reference Card](http://scrumreferencecard.com/)\r\n\r\n[Scrum Training Series](http://scrumtrainingseries.com/)\r\n\r\n[Scrum Master Checklist](http://scrummasterchecklist.org/)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
